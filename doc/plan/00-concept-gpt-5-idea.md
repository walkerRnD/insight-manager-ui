Idea from GPT-5

[prompt]

I want to create an app that uses ai to manage user's feature request, bug report and internal feature roadmap like user story map.
it has to integrate the feature reques, bug report, user story map request and presentation.

please give me 3 name ideas and project description for the product manager of this project.

please think hard about this

**Thought for 21s**

Awesome idea. Here are three strong brand options, each with a crisp PM-ready project description you can hand to the team.

# 1) SignalScope

**One-liner:** Turn raw user “signals” into scoped, prioritized epics and a living user-story map—automatically.

**Problem & insight:** Feedback, bug reports, and roadmap ideas live in silos. PMs spend hours deduping, clustering, and justifying priorities without a clear link to impact.

**Solution:** An AI ingestion and triage layer that unifies requests, bugs, and product analytics into a single Story Map OS. It clusters duplicates, extracts pain points, proposes scope, and generates presentation-ready updates.

**Primary users:** PMs, EMs, Support/Success leaders, Tech Leads, Founders.

**Core capabilities**

- Multi-source ingestion: email, in-app widget, Intercom/Zendesk, App/Play reviews, Slack, GitHub Issues, Jira/Linear.
- AI triage: dedupe, semantic clustering, sentiment, user impact scoring, root-cause hints for bugs (auto-extracted steps & affected versions).
- Prioritization: RICE/ICE/MoSCoW with explainable scoring; scenario “what-if” (e.g., optimize for activation vs. retention).
- Story Map: auto-generate user story map from clusters → epics → slices; drag-and-drop with AI “suggest next slice.”
- Roadmap views: Now/Next/Later, quarterly, and theme-based.
- Presentations: one-click brief → Google Slides/PowerPoint; release notes & changelog drafts.
- Governance: feedback lineage (every roadmap item shows which customers/bugs justify it), approval workflows, audit log.

**MVP (8–10 weeks)**

- Ingestion (CSV + Slack + Jira/Linear + Intercom).
- Clustering/dedup + basic RICE + Story Map generation.
- Now/Next/Later roadmap + slide export.
- Feedback lineage & simple roles/permissions.

**Success metrics**

- ≥60% reduction in manual triage time.
- ≥30% increase in “feedback referenced in roadmap” rate.
- Presentation export used ≥2× per month per PM.
- NPS from PMs ≥45.

**Risks & mitigations**

- Hallucinated scope → require “evidence pins” (linked feedback) before an item can be moved to “Planned.”
- Data privacy → SOC2-ready architecture, PII redaction on ingestion, SSO/SCIM.

# 2) StoryGrid AI

**One-liner:** The AI workspace that grids every request and bug into a coherent user-story map and delivery plan.

**Value prop:** Combines qualitative feedback with quantitative usage to recommend slices that ship measurable outcomes, not just features.

**Core capabilities**

- “Intake to Grid”: requests/bugs land as nodes; AI groups by job-to-be-done and maps them across **Backbone → Activities → Tasks → Stories** .
- Impact modeling: links clusters to metrics (activation, conversion, retention) and suggests KPI targets.
- AI scope composer: turns clusters into epics with acceptance criteria, non-goals, risks, and test ideas.
- Bug intelligence: groups crash logs & user reports, surfaces likely component ownership, suggests repro scripts.
- Executive mode: theme-level brief, budget/time estimates, and trade-off scenarios.

**Integrations**

Jira/Linear, GitHub, Slack, Intercom/Zendesk, Notion/Confluence, Mixpanel/GA, LaunchDarkly.

**MVP**

- Grid view + AI grouping by JTBD.
- Epic/story drafts with acceptance criteria.
- KPI tagging + Mixpanel event picker.
- Export to Jira/Linear + Notion brief.

**KPIs**

- Time from intake → planned epic: median ≤ 48h.
- % epics with metric linkage: ≥70%.
- % bugs auto-grouped to owner team: ≥80%.

**Differentiator:** Anchors everything to user-story mapping structure by default—less “tag soup,” more outcome-oriented planning.

# 3) Weaveboard

**One-liner:** Weave user signals, bugs, and business goals into one board—then hit “Present” for exec-ready storytelling.

**Positioning:** A narrative-first product ops layer: the same place you triage is the place you tell the story of _why_ you’re building it.

**Core capabilities**

- Signal Weaving: merges feedback threads, support tags, and bug clusters into themes with confidence scores.
- Priority Playbooks: choose a strategy (Retention Push, Onboarding Win, Performance Blitz); AI re-ranks and proposes a release slice plan.
- Roadmap & Slices: drag slices across releases; AI warns about dependency risk and team capacity.
- Presentation Studio: auto builds a storyline (Problem → Evidence → Plan → Impact), exports slides, and a shareable web link.
- Stakeholder feedback loop: lightweight voting, comment summarization, “decision diary.”

**MVP**

- Theming & dedupe with confidence scores.
- Release slice planning with capacity check.
- Presentation Studio (slides + web view).
- Stakeholder comments → AI summary → decision capture.

**KPIs**

- Exec review prep time: −70%.
- % roadmap items with evidence links: ≥90%.
- Stakeholder satisfaction (CSAT on reviews): ≥4.5/5.

**Differentiators**

- Narrative mode that auto-creates exec-ready artifacts.
- Strategy playbooks to align prioritization with business goals.

## Shared architecture notes (for your tech lead)

- **Pipelines:** Ingestion → PII redaction → Embedding store → Clustering (HDBSCAN/graph-based) → Ranking (impact, frequency, sentiment) → Drafting (LLM) → Human review.
- **Explainability:** Every AI suggestion shows evidence, assumptions, and editable scoring.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Required approval for scope and prioritization before sync to Jira/Linear.
- **Compliance:** SSO, RBAC, tenant isolation, data retention controls.
